Welcome! This repository is a collection of my journey through [Kyle Simpson's](https://frontendmasters.com/teachers/kyle-simpson/) "["Deep JavaScript Foundations v3"](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/deep-javascript-v3/)" workshop. It combines the original workshop exercises, test cases and original solutions with my solutions and extensive notes. My goal is to share my learning process and hopefully provide a valuable resource for others exploring the depths of JavaScript.
